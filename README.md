# Admin Dashboard

This project was created for [admin dashboard assignment](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/node-path-intermediate-html-and-css-admin-dashboard) as part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com) curriculum. Note that the purpose of this project is only to apply Grid Layout(a lot of buttons and links not work).
